# link-to qp stickiness

Load the application at `http://localhost:4200/?q=helloworld` and you will see both `LinkTo` and `href-to` return href attributes with the query param in them even though they are not specified when both the component and helper are used. The expectation here is that both href attributes would not contain any query params since none were passed in as arguments.

The issue is that both LinkTo and href-to rely on the internal service:-routing.generateURL which in turns uses a (hydration technique on query params)[https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/a429dc327ee6ef97d948a83e727886c75c6fe043/packages/%40ember/-internals/routing/lib/system/router.ts#L1020-L1030], probably used for restoring app state when a page loads? The better method seems to be the (service:router.urlFor method)[https://api.emberjs.com/ember/3.10/classes/RouterService/methods?anchor=urlFor]. The latter would allow usage where what you specify in the helper or component would be what drives the href value with no side effects.
